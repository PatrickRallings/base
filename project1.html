                <p><ol><li>
                <b>Be an All-Star</b> <br/>
                - Have long-term goals that can drive your motivation
                </li><p/>
                <p> <li><b>Be a Teammate </b><br/>
                	- Listen to teammate’s "Why’s" to understand their motivations and work with them better <br/>
                    - Build relationships <br/>
                    - Create “high-five” culture (Basketball teams that play with nothing to game: Those that high-five each other perform better on average)
                </p></li>
                <p> <li><b>C’s Don’t Get Degrees</b><br/>
                	- Being average, or just as good as the person next to you, will not allow you to get promotions or success and work with them better <br/>
                    </p></li>
                    <p> <li><b>Win with the WIN Staff</b><br/>
                        - Use the staff as a resource <br/>
                        - Don’t keep asking questions without building your own ability to find answers <br/>
                    </p></li>
                    <p> <li><b>Believe </b><br/>
                        - Believe in your ability to achieve your own goals

                    Front end designers usually work with the style and designs themselves,

                <li>
                    Front end engineers aren’t that involved in the design, but work with
                    compiling the code (kind of the back end of the front end)

                    updated software)

                 <b>Cybersecurity:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity is the most interesting tech “role” because of its almost
                limitless potential. Seemingly every aspect of technology, that manipulates
                data, could benefit from some form of cybersecurity. Networks and other
                data-driven technologies will continue to prosper from innovations,
                broadening the already massive scope of cybersecurity’s pervue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cybersecurity is a blanket term which can be applied across a large number
                of differing roles. In general, cybersecurity relates to programming
                techniques which aid in the identifying and/or securing of various digital
                threats. These threats can come in many forms, including SQL injecting,
                DDOSing, and APTs. Without the aid of cybersecurity, such attacks could
                cause enormous damages to organizations. One of the many interesting
                cybersecurity roles is known as ethical hacking. Ethical hacking is
                essentially the hacking of an organization without ill-intent to expose any
                flaws in their existing cybersecurity. However, cybersecurity roles are not
                always so extravagant, and can also extend to much smaller tasks, such as
                maintaining the security of employee badge information. Like back-end
                developers, roles in cybersecurity will require proficiency in any relevant
                coding languages. Cybersecurity developers will also need to understand the
                fundamentals behind network architecture and a variety of other systems in
                which they may be securing. Knowledge of any relevant infrastructure will
                be crucial for a developer to be able to identify any potential threats and
                secure them.

                The role of scrum master is interesting due to its combination of tech,
                organization, and interpersonal skills. As someone who has not yet gained a
                deep knowledge of software development, but has strong interpersonal
                skills, the role of scrum master currently best suits me. As such, the role
                naturally draws my attention. Additionally, many of the tasks of a scrum
                master, such as helping others achieve objectives and conflict resolution,
                are tasks which I am both good at and enjoy doing.

                The role of the scrum master is to lead teams towards their goals, through
                a variety of techniques, while utilizing the Agile project management
                techniques. From the business to the individual level, scrum masters work
                to facilitate development, clear impeding obstacles, and open lines of
                communication for team members. Scrum masters will work closely with
                product owners and help them plan future goals while maintaining Agile
                practices. They essentially act as the connection between the project
                managers and development teams. One of the most important tasks of a scrum
                master is that of being an effective coach for their team members. Without
                effective coaching, teams would lose efficiency and effectiveness. Scrum
                masters benefit from having a strong understanding of full-stack
                development and/or whatever projects their teams are working on as well as
                proficient knowledge of the agile project management techniques.
                Additionally, scrum masters should have good organization skills, be able
                to effectively communicate, have empathetic tendencies, and be great at conflict resolution.

                 <b>Back-End Development:</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The role of back-end development is interesting due to its role in
                providing effective programming solutions in the interest of speed and
                efficiency. Finding solutions to problems has always been a great area of
                interest and confidence for me. Furthermore, front-end coding could be
                ambiguous in its potential, due to the subjective nature of design and
                practicality, while back-end benchmarks would be based in efficiency and
                therefore definite, which is a quality that I value in objectives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Back-end development, otherwise known as server-side development, is
                essentially the development and/or manipulation data “behind the scenes” of
                software. In the metaphor of a vehicle, the front-end would be the design
                of the car, such as the body shape, while the back-end would be the cars
                engine. Development in the back-end will usually involve working with
                databases, languages, and frameworks. It will lay the foundational code
                that then enables specific processes to take place based off manipulations
                in the client-facing front-end. The top back-end programming languages
                include Java, PHP, and .NET, each of which have correlating frameworks to
                utilize for efficiency. Back-end developers should be proficient in one or
                more of the aforementioned languages, or other back-end optimized
                languages, as well as be familiar with the relevant frameworks. Back-end
                developers will also likely need to know how to manage APIs, or application
                program interfaces, and be able to manage databases, among a variety of
                other concepts.
